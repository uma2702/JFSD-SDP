            <p><b>Pacita Abad (1946–2004)</b></p>
            <p>Pacita Abad was born in Basco, Batanes, a small island in the northernmost part of the Philippines, between Luzon and Taiwan. 
                Her more than 30-year painting career 
                began when she traveled to the United States to undertake graduate studies in Spain</p>
            </br>
            Her early paintings were primarily figurative socio-political works of people and primitive masks. 
            Another series was large scale paintings of underwater scenes, tropical flowers and animal wildlife. 
            Pacita's most extensive body of work, however, is her vibrant, colorful abstract work - many very large scale canvases, 
            but also a number of small collages - on a range of materials from canvas and paper to bark cloth, metal, ceramics and glass. 
            Abad created over 4,500 artworks.[5] She painted a 55-meter long Alkaff Bridge in Singapore
             and covered it with 2,350 multicolored circles, just a few months before she died.

            <p><b>Pio Abad (born 1983)</b>
                In his practice, Pio Abad looks into the social and political significance of objects usually consigned to the sidelines 
                of history. Abad uses different media such as textile, drawing, installation, and photography, and employs strategies of 
                appropriation to extract alternative readings and repressed historical events. Abad ties threads of complicity between events, 
                ideologies and people. His artworks glide seamlessly between these histories, enacting quasi-fictional combinations with their 
                leftovers and weaving together threads of complicity between events, ideologies, and people. Abad was artist-in-residence at KADIST
                 San Francisco from April to June 2019, where he conducted 
                research into narratives of exile and displacement from the 1970s and 80s that brought Filipinos to California.

                <p><b> Absalon
                    1964–1993</b>
                    In the course of six years Absalon created a series of one person living units based on everyday routine actions and designed entirely
                     in relation to his measures. The inside of the cell is all covered in white in order to reduce distractions or elements that can
                      disturb the eye. In his video Solutions (1992) Absalon demonstrate the study of measurements and calculation of movements 
                      like eating, sleeping, taking shower which later will define the form of his cells. In 1993 Absalon started to construct six cells 
                      which were supposed to be installed in six metropolitan centers[6] as Absalon described in interview: "I would like to create my own 
                      setting and belong to nothing else. 
                    My living unit will be comprised of the six habitation units which I construct, and my homeland will be in-between them."[

                <p><b>Norman Adams
                    1927–2005</b></p>
                    Norman's work continued a rich tradition of romantic visionary painting more frequently 
                    encountered in Britain than elsewhere. There are close links between his output and that of earlier English painters, 
                    such as Blake and Turner. As a young painter, Norman wanted to fuse the qualities of these two great predecessors; although
                     he recognised that Blake never had much feeling for paint, 
                    he admired "the poetry and political verse, his intensity and his integrity".

                <p><b> Ai Weiwei
                    born 1957</b>
                    Ai Weiwei (Chinese: 艾未未; pinyin: Ài Wèiwèi, English pronunciation: (help·info); born 28 August 1957) is a Chinese contemporary artist,
                     documentarian, and activist. Ai grew up in the far northwest of China, where he lived under harsh conditions due to his father's exile.
                       [1] As an activist, he has been openly critical of the Chinese Government's stance on democracy and human rights.
                      He investigated government corruption and cover-ups, in particular the Sichuan schools corruption scandal following the collapse of 
                      "tofu-dreg schools" in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In 2011, Ai Weiwei was arrested at Beijing Capital International Airport on 
                      3 April, for "economic crimes". He was detained for 81 days without charge. Ai Weiwei emerged as a vital instigator in Chinese 
                      cultural development, 
                    an architect of Chinese modernism, and one of the nation's most vocal political commentators.[1]

                 <p><b> Abbas Akhavan
                    born 1990</b>
                    Abbas Akhavan is a Montreal-based visual artist.[1] His recent work consists of site-specific installations,
                     sculpture, video, and performance, consistently in response to the environment in which the work is created.[1] 
                     Akhavan was born in Tehran, Iran in 1977. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from Concordia University in 2004 
                     and his Master of Fine Arts from the University of British Columbia in 2006.[1] Akhavan's family immigrated to Canada 
                     from Iran during the Iran-Iraq war.[2] His work has gained international acclaim, exhibiting in museums, galleries and biennales 
                     all over North America, Europe and the Middle East.[3] He is the recipient of the Kunstpreis Berlin 
                    (2012),[1] the Abraaj Group Art Prize (2014),[4] and the Sobey Art Award (2015).[5]

                <p><b> Anni Albers
                    1899–1994</b>
                    Anni Albers was born Annelise Elsa Frieda Fleischmann on June 12, 1899, in Berlin, Germany.
                     Her mother was from a family in the publishing industry and her father was a furniture maker.
                      Even in her childhood, she was intrigued by art and the visual world. She painted during her youth 
                      and studied under impressionist artist Martin Brandenburg, from 1916 to 1919,[2] but was very discouraged 
                      from continuing after a meeting with artist Oskar Kokoschka, 
                    who upon seeing a portrait of hers asked her sharply "Why do you paint?"[

                    <p><b>Alken Family
                        1756–1894</b>
                        Henry Samuel Alken was the eldest son of Henry Thomas Alken (1785-1851), and grandson of Samuel 
                        Alken Senior (1756-1815). He tended to paint in sets and usually depicted sporting scenes.
                         Paul Mellon KBE's collection of the artist's original drawings, watercolours, and oils was immense. 
                         Perhaps the most renowned of Henry Alken Jnr's four paintings sets is that recording the hunt at Belvoir Castle, 
                         which was also handled by Arthur Ackermann & Son. These oils reflect the palette and feeling of the artist's work,
                         as well as displaying his respective strengths in capturing horses and their movement, and weaknesses in the portrayal
                           of human faces. The owners of the country house, depicted in the left background of Setting Out, may point to the origins
                            of the commission.
                         It has been suggested that the house is Woburn Abbey, the family seat of the Duke of Bedford.
